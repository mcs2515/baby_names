				<h3>About:</h3>
				<p>Ever carious about the popularity of a baby name over time? Look no further because the graphs on this website will show you just that! To start, enter a name in the text field and either press the enter button on your broad or press the search button. You will see a line and points pop up on the first graph. This line shows you the popularity of that name from 1990 to 2014. If you click on one of the points on the line graph, the graph below it will show a bar graph. These bars tell you further information about that name during that year. Each bar and its height shows you the occurrence of that name used in each US state. Remember, you can search up five names at a time!</p>

				<h3>The Story:</h3>
				<p>You'll noticed that a lot of names searched have been on the decline; at least between 1990 to 2014. Seems surprising right? You probably figured that some lines to be increasing in popularity overall. However, the occurrences of names are declining because the US total population is also decreasing each year which makes it seem that the popularity of the name is declining. You will also notice that the bar graph that shows the occurrence of the name was especially high in California compared to the other states.  This is due to the fact that CA, out of the other states, has a high population of people.</p>
				<p>With this all-in mind, the popularity of baby names should be determined by the slope of each line between points. The steeper the slope, the faster the popularity of that name is increasing or decreasing. When looking at the corresponding bar graph of the name, you need to keep in mind that the length of each bar does not tell you the population for each state which does affect the actual popularity of the name when comparing its occurrence in other states.</p>
